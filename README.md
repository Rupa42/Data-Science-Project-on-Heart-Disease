## Introduction
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction of heart disease can help in better diagnosis and timely treatment. This project uses supervised learning techniques to classify whether a patient is at risk of heart disease based on medical attributes.

---

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is from [source name, e.g., UCI Heart Disease Dataset]. It contains the following attributes:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol Level
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG Results
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Exercise Induced Angina
- ST Depression
- Slope of the ST Segment
- Number of Major Vessels
- Thalassemia
- Target: 0 (No Heart Disease) or 1 (Heart Disease)
